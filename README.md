# Movie Analyzer
This project includes creating a graph using the MovieLens Data (where the nodes are movies) and a text-based interface that allows 
the user to explore the graph. The program gives the user 3 choices for defining adjacency for the graph and creates the graph. Once
the graph is created the user is given options to print out statistics about the graph (including the number of nodes or edges, the 
density of the graph, the maximum degree, the diameter, and the average length of the shortest paths -- computed using the Floyd-Warshall 
algorithm), print out node information, or display the shortest path between two nodes -- computed using Dijkstra's algorithm.
